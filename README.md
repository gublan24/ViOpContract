# ViOpContract
ViOpContract is a prototype tool that helps developers to draw visual operation contracts. It is an Eclipse plug-in. The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides the means of representing the graphical elements of the visual contracts such as components, layers, and links. The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) is used to implement the data model of ViOpContract. The workplace data is saved as an XMI format file ends with “.voc” extension. The visual editor of ViOpContract allows developers to extract the visual operation contracts as images, zooming them in and out, and transforming them to the textual format.

The main view of ViOpContract starts with two basic window tabs, or views. The first view helps to draw the domain model. The second view is the system operation view, which allows the addition of visual operation contracts to the system operations. Then, each visual operation contracts will have its own view.
